# Code of Conduct

We are committed to fostering an open and inclusive environment for everyone interested in human activity understanding. All contributors, maintainers, and community members must adhere to this Code of Conduct.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and respect in all interactions.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Acknowledging different viewpoints and experiences.
- Focusing on what is best for the community and project.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment, discrimination, or exclusionary jokes.
- Personal attacks or political/religious arguments unrelated to the project.
- Publishing others' private information (doxxing) without consent.
- Disruption of discussions, spam, or off-topic promotion.

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to violations. Maintainers have the right to remove comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces (GitHub Issues, Discussions, Pull Requests) and external channels when representing the project or the broader community (conferences, social media, meetups).

## Enforcement

Report violations via the project's security/contact email (to be published in `SECURITY.md`) or by contacting a maintainer through GitHub. All reports will be reviewed promptly and kept confidential. Maintainers must follow a complaint-resolution process aligned with the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1.
