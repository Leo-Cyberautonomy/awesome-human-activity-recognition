# Security Policy

We take data security, privacy, and responsible disclosure seriously. Use this guide to report issues or concerns.

## Supported Scope

Report the following:
- Exposed credentials, API keys, or private dataset links within this repository.
- License compliance issues that could impact dataset authors.
- Vulnerabilities in tooling (scripts, workflows) that may lead to data corruption or remote code execution.

Out of scope:
- Dataset-specific vulnerabilities that must be reported directly to the dataset owners.
- General feature requests or documentation gaps (use GitHub Issues instead).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. Email the maintainers at `security@human-activity-intel.org` (placeholder; update when operational).
2. Include a detailed description, reproduction steps, and potential impact.
3. Encrypt sensitive reports using the PGP key published in `docs/security-pgp.asc` (planned).

We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and provide an estimated remediation timeline. Please do not create public issues for security concerns.

## Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate coordinated disclosure. Do not share vulnerability details publicly until a fix is released or we agree on disclosure timing.
