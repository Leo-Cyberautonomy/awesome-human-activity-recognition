abstract: >-
  A curated, living catalog of 40+ human activity recognition (HAR) and action recognition datasets 
  across vision-based (RGB/depth video), wearable sensors (IMU, smartwatch), skeleton/mocap, 
  and multimodal domains. Each dataset card provides licensing, benchmark baselines, SOTA leaderboards, 
  download instructions, and canonical paper citations. Built for ML researchers, product teams, 
  and motion science labs to accelerate discovery and prototyping.
